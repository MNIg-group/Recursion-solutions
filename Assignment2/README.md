# merge sort

1. Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. An input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and an input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].

2. Tips:
    1. Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same function!).

    2. It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you donâ€™t quite understand what should be going on.
